# Delegates
[See usage](https://github.com/asalom/Cocoa-Design-Patterns-in-Swift/tree/master/DesignPatterns/DesignPatternsTests/Decoupling/Delegates)

Use delegates when you need communicate information from one object to another without in later knowing anything else from the first other than the protocol it implements. For example, fill data of a table view, configure table view, etc.
