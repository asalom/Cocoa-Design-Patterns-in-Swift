# Prototype
[See usage](https://github.com/asalom/Cocoa-Design-Patterns-in-Swift/tree/master/DesignPatterns/DesignPatternsTests/Decoupling/Prototype)

The prototype pattern is a creational pattern used to instantiate a new object by copying all of the properties of an existing object, creating an independent clone. This practise is particularly useful when the construction of a new object is inefficient.
