[See usage](https://github.com/asalom/Cocoa-Design-Patterns-in-Swift/tree/master/DesignPatterns/DesignPatternsTests/Decoupling/Hierarchies)

Known in other languages as the Composite Pattern.
> In software engineering, the composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern. The composite pattern describes that a group of objects is to be treated in the same way as a single instance of an object. The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
