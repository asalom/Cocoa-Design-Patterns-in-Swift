# Mediator
[See usage](https://github.com/asalom/Cocoa-Design-Patterns-in-Swift/tree/master/DesignPatterns/DesignPatternsTests/Hide%20Complexity/Mediator)

The mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.

Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby lowering the coupling.
