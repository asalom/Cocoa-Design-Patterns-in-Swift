# Façade
[See usage](https://github.com/asalom/Cocoa-Design-Patterns-in-Swift/tree/master/DesignPatterns/DesignPatternsTests/Hide%20Complexity/Facade)

A façade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library. 

> When the full complexity of a subsystem is required, a simplified façade adds little value and might actually increase the effort needed to effectively use the subsistem. If the façade interface is too complex or duplicates too many details of the hidden classes, it probably adds no value.
