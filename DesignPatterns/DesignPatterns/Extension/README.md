# Extension
[See usage](https://github.com/asalom/Cocoa-Design-Patterns-in-Swift/tree/master/DesignPatterns/DesignPatternsTests/Extension)

Extensions add new functionality to an existing class, structure, or enumeration type. This includes the ability to extend types for which you do not have access to the original source code (known as retroactive modeling). Extensions are similar to categories in Objective-C. (Unlike Objective-C categories, Swift extensions do not have names.)

Extensions in Swift can:

1. Add computed properties and computed static properties
2. Define instance methods and type methods
3. Provide new initializers
4. Define subscripts
5. Define and use new nested types
6. Make an existing type conform to a protocol”

Excerpt From: Apple Inc. “The Swift Programming Language.” iBooks. https://itun.es/de/jEUH0.l

> Extensions can add new computed properties, but they cannot add stored properties, or add property observers to existing properties.
